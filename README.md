# Revenant
Python scripts to take data from CAPI and load them into google sheets. 

[Canonn - Guardians](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p20iT3HWAcRRJ8Cw60Z2tCVTpcBavhycvE0Jgg0h32Y) -- All things related to guardians

[Canonn - Surface Biology](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15lqZtqJk7B2qUV5Jb4tlnst6i1B7pXlAUzQnacX64Kc) -- All things related to surface biology

[Canonn - Lagrange Clouds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11BCZRci0YlgW0sFdxvB_srq7ssxHzstMAiewhSGHE94) -- Lagrange Clouds and their content

# Not currently fit for use. You will need a google service account clinet secrets and your own spreadheets to run these yourself 

# TODO

Need to modify the scripts to make them runable anywhere and put the sheet id's into a config file.
